# Weather Dashboard ‚òÅÔ∏èüå§Ô∏èüåßÔ∏è

This is a simple and morden weather dashboard built using **React** , **Material-UI**, and the **OpenWeather API**.The dashboard allows users to search for weather conditions in any city around the world, displaying relevant weather data along with appropriate icons for different weather conditions. I made this app as a simple way to practice fetching data from an API and building intuitive user interfaces that are also interesting to look at.

## Features

- **Search functionality:** Enter any city to get real-time weather data.

- **Weather conditions:** Displays weather details like, temparature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

- **Dynamic icons:** Show relevant weather icons based on current weather conditions (sun, rain, clouds, snow).

- **Responsive design:** The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Frontend design:** Uses a dark blue background with neon text for a modern, high-contrast design.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Material-UI(MUI):** A popular React UI framework for designing components.

- **Material-UI(MUI):** A popular React UI framework for designing components.

- **OpenWeather API:** A weather data provider to get real-time weather information based on user input.

- **TypeScript:** For better type safety and development experience.
